This game is a turn based RPG.
The player can run around a dungeon opening doors and chests.
Once the player has done so many steps it will cause a battle to occur.
The player will battle against the enemy and if they win will gain experience and eventually level up.
Once the player reaches the end of the dungeon they will encounter a boss to fight against.
